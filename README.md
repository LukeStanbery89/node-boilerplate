# Node Boilerplate Application

This is a template repository for an ERN ([Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), [React.js](https://react.dev/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)) stack application. This template includes boilerplate code for:
- Node.js backend
- React.js frontend
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for frontend global state management
- Build pipeline (using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/))
- Unit tests ([Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/))
- WebSockets (using [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/))
- Backend event emission framework (using Node's [EventEmitter API](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html))
- Development server with hot reloading
- PR build pipeline (using [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions))
- Git hooks (using [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/))
